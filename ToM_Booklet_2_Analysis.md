## 11. DATA STORAGE REQUIREMENTS

### Session Variables to Store
1. `childAge` - Age of child (determines item inclusion)
2. `gradeChoice` - Grade input from introduction
3. `childChoice1` - Apple or strawberry preference
4. `opposite1` - Opposite of childChoice1
5. `childChoice2` - Trail mix or granola bar preference
6. `opposite2` - Opposite of childChoice2
7. `childChoice3` - Backpack or desk guess
8. `opposite3` - Opposite of childChoice3

### Response Data to Store (Per Question)
- `questionId` - Unique identifier (e.g., "ToMS_2AFC_1.1")
- `itemNumber` - Item number (1, 1.5, 2, etc.)
- `questionType` - 2AFC, Expl, Cont, 2AFCImp
- `childResponse` - The actual response (text, audio file path, or choice)
- `responseTime` - Timestamp of response
- `audioFilePath` - For Expl questions
- `transcriptionText` - For Expl questions
- `correctAnswer` - Expected/target answer (if applicable)
- `scored` - Boolean (true/false)
- `pointsAwarded` - Scoring value

### Drag-and-Drop Interaction Data
- `dragObjectId` - What was dragged
- `dropTargetId` - Where it was dropped
- `correctTarget` - Expected target
- `wasCorrect` - Boolean

## 12. TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION NOTES

### Required Features
1. **Age Gate**: Collect age at start, conditionally show/hide items
2. **Variable Storage System**: Store and recall child choices with opposites
3. **Drag-and-Drop Interface**: For Rachel cutout and snack items
4. **Audio Recording**: Capture explanation responses
5. **Audio Transcription**: Convert speech to text (API integration)
6. **Conditional Scripting**: Dynamic text based on answers
7. **Progress Tracking**: Current item, completion percentage
8. **Data Export**: CSV/JSON format with all responses
9. **Multi-page Navigation**: 19+ items with transitions
10. **Audio Playback**: For narration with British English option

### Illustration Files Needed
- MIT_BOOKLET_ColorFINAL_0.png through MIT_BOOKLET_ColorFINAL_19.png (20 files)
- Rachel_Story.pdf (for Item 1.5)
- MIT_BOOKLET_ExtraPartsSheetFINAL_1_2_3_4_5.png
- MIT_BOOKLET_ExtraPartsSheetFINAL_6_7_9.png
- MIT_BOOKLET_ExtraPartsSheetFINAL_10_11_12_13_14.png

### Cutout Assets to Extract
From extra parts sheets, extract individual PNG assets for:
- Characters: Rachel, Henry, Kari, Carmen, Diana, Sean, Sue, Allie, Sarah
- Food items: Apple, strawberries, trail mix, granola bar, raisins (boxes), pear, fruit snacks, orange, cookies, snacks
- Interactive targets: Yellow mat container, blue mat container, various locations

## 14. CRITICAL DEPENDENCIES MAP

### childChoice1 Dependencies
- Used in: ToMS_2AFC_1.1 script
- Opposite1 used in: Same question
- Must be collected before: Item 1 question

### childChoice2 Dependencies
- Used in: ToMS_2AFC_2.1 script
- Opposite2 used in: Same question
- Must be collected before: Item 2 question

### childChoice3 Dependencies
- Used in: ToMS_2AFC_3.1 script
- Opposite3 used in: Same question
- Must be collected before: Item 3 question

### childAge Dependencies
- Determines inclusion of: Items 11, 17, 18, 19
- Must be collected: At start (during/after introduction)
- Logic: If age < 5, skip marked items

## 15. VALIDATION REQUIREMENTS

### Response Validation
- **2AFC questions**: Must select one of two options
- **Drag-and-drop**: Must place object in valid drop zone
- **Audio recording**: Minimum 1 second, maximum 2 minutes
- **Transcription**: Must complete before proceeding
- **Age input**: Must be valid number (3-12 range expected)

### Completeness Checks
- All scored questions must have responses
- Audio files must be saved successfully
- Transcriptions must be stored
- Drag-and-drop actions must be recorded
