# ToM Booklet #1 - Digital Version

## Introduction

This is a story about a classroom. These kids are all in X grade [usually try to match this to the participant's grade], just like you! It's reading time in this classroom. The teacher, Mr. Abbott, calls all the kids over to read their books. The children all get up to look for their books. We're going to see what they do, and help them find their books, OK? Are you ready?

Here is Jonathan. Jonathan is looking for his book. His book might be under the table, or it might be behind the reading chair. Without peeking, where do you think the book is: under the table, or behind the reading chair?

**ToMB1_2AFC_03:** That's a good guess! But Jonathan thinks his book is [other one]. So where will Jonathan look for his book: under the table or behind the chair?

OK, let's watch Jonathan look there.

[If he finds it: Oh great! There's his book! If he doesn't find it: Uh oh. It's not there. Can you help Jonathan find his book?]

**Script:**
This morning when he came to school, Ethan put his book above the coat hooks. What color is Ethan's book? That's right- it's blue! And then he went outside to play - see? Here's Ethan playing outside. And while he was outside playing, Ethan's book fell down from above the coat hooks to behind the coats, see? Then Paul comes in - and Paul put his book up here, above the coat hooks. What color is Paul's book? That's right- it's blue! But Ethan is still outside playing, so he didn't see what Paul was doing.

**ToMB1_2AFC_09:** Now, when Ethan comes in from outside, where will he look first for his book: up on the shelf, or behind the coats?

Let's see what he does.

**ToMB1_EXPL_10:** Oh look, here is Ethan reaching for this (Paul's) book up on the shelf. Why is Ethan reaching for the book on the shelf?

**ToMB1_EXPL_11:** And now Paul sees Ethan reaching for that book, and he gets really upset. Why does Paul feel sad?

**ToMB1_2AFC_12:** Is Ethan being mean and naughty for taking Paul's book? Why/why not?

### 11. Interpretation
**Illustration:** ToM_Booklet_14.png - ToM_Booklet_15.png

**Script:**
This is Chloe. And Chloe is playing a really silly game today and not saying any words all day long. Instead, she's drawing pictures. So now it's reading time, and Chloe wants Mr. Abbott to get a book down from the top shelf for her. Up on the top shelf is a book about witches, and a book about sailboats. Chloe wants the book about witches, but she doesn't know how to draw a whole witch, because that's kind of hard. So she draws a picture of a witch's hat, and a picture of a witch's broom [put these down separately as you say them].

**ToMB1_2AFC_19:** Which picture should Chloe give to Mr. Abbott, so he will get her the book about witches and not the book about boats?

**ToMB1_EXPL_20:** Why is this clue better than that one? (If prediction question was answered incorrectly: Actually, she shows Mr. Abbot this clue. Why is this clue better?)

Can you help Mr. Abbott get down the book about witches, for Chloe?

OK, we're all done! Good job!

### 1. Common Desires

### 3. False Belief - Reality Known
**Illustration:** ToM_Booklet_18.png - ToM_Booklet_19.png

**Script:**
Ok, now everyone is going to play hide and seek. So Joshua closes his eyes and counts to ten, and the other kids go and hide. But look - Joshua is peeking a little. You're not supposed to do that, are you? And while he's peeking, Joshua sees Ivan hide behind the bush. Then Joshua closes his eyes really tight and keeps counting. While Joshua has his eyes closed really tight, so he can't see, Ivan moves from behind the bush, to behind the playhouse.

So tell me- where is Ivan right now? [Behind the bush or in the play house?]
(Correct if wrong by repeating last line of story)

**ToMB2_2AFC_23:** Ok, now Joshua is going to come looking for Ivan. Where will Joshua look first for Ivan? [Behind the bush or in the play house?]

**ToMB2_EXPL_24:** Oh look - Joshua is looking behind the bush. Can you explain - why is Joshua looking behind the bush?

[OK, now can you put Joshua where Ivan really is?]

**Script:**
Now it's snack time, and Mother brought one cookie for each kid. Joshua puts his cookie down on the grass, and then he goes to the picnic basket to get a juice box. And while he's getting his juice box, mother moves his cookie from the grass, to the blanket, because she doesn't want it to get dirty. Now Isabel takes her cookie, and she puts it down on the grass, while Joshua is still getting his juice box.

**ToMB2_2AFC_25:** Now, when Joshua comes back from getting juice, which cookie will he take? The one in the grass or the one under the blanket?

**ToMB2_EXPL_26:**
- If correct: Can you tell me why?
- If incorrect: Actually, Joshua takes the cookie from the grass (place Joshua in correct location). Can you tell me why?

**ToMB2_EXPL_27:** Isabel sees Joshua taking that cookie and starts to cry. Why does Isabel get mad and start crying?

**ToMB2_2AFC_28:** Is Joshua being mean and naughty for taking Isabel's cookie? Why?

### 5. Emotion Reminder
**Illustration:** ToM_Booklet_21.png

**Script:**
This is a picture from last week. And last week, when they came to the park, Sprint was playing with a friendly black puppy. He was really cute and friendly and everyone was having a good time with him. But then during snack time last week, the black puppy stole Ivan's cookie, and ran away with it! Now, while the kids are having their snack today, Sprint is running around playing with the same friendly black puppy. The black puppy comes running over to the kids, wagging his tail.

**ToMB2_2AFC_30:** How will Ivan feel when he sees the black puppy? Happy or sad?

**ToMB2_2AFC_31:** Will Ivan want to go near the puppy, or far away from the puppy?

### 6. Expectation
**Illustration:** ToM_Booklet_22.png

**Script:**
Every week, mother puts milk in this yellow bottle, and brings it to the park for snack time. But this week, they were all out of milk, and mom didn't have time to go to the store to get more, so she put orange juice in the yellow bottle instead. Now it's snack time, and Isabel wants a drink.

When she sees the bottle, Isabel says "Oh good! Exactly what I wanted!"

**ToMB2_2AFC_33:** What does Isabel think is in the bottle? Milk or orange juice?

Why does she think that?

**ToMB2_2AFC_34:** When Isabel drinks from the bottle, how will she feel? [Will she feel happy or sad?] Why?

### 7. Interpretation
**Illustration:** ToM_Booklet_23.png

**Script:**
Now, snack time is over, and the three kids are playing a new game. Here's how the game goes: One kid hides, but draws a clue in the sandbox so the other kids can find them. So Ivan is going first. He draws this clue in the sandbox, and then he goes to hide. Where do you think Isabel and Joshua should look for Ivan? How did you know? (Not coded- just introducing the game to the participant).

OK, now it's Joshua's turn to leave a clue, and hide. Isabel and Ivan will then try to use the clue to find him. Joshua decides to hide behind the drinking fountain. So he draws a clue like this: here is the bottom metal part of the fountain, and here is lots of water coming out of it. [drawing looks much more like a tree]. Then Joshua goes to hide behind the fountain.

What is this a picture of?

(Note: this question is meant to be about what this picture is supposed to be - but it's true that this question is kind of ambiguous. so if the child doesn't get it, we can ask it again, like what did Joshua mean to draw?"; Do not tell children that the drawing looks like a tree).

**ToMB2_2AFC_35:** When Isabel and Ivan see this clue, where will they look first for Joshua?

**ToMB2_EXPL_36:** Oh look, Ivan and Isabel are looking behind the tree for Joshua - why are they looking behind the tree for Joshua?

Can you help them find where Joshua really is?

### 8. False Beliefs About Moral Harms/Deception
**Illustration:** ToM_Booklet_24.png

**Script:**
Now the games are over, and it's almost time to go home. Mother tells the kids to find all of their toys. Joshua brought his toy truck with him to the park, but now he can't find it. He's looking everywhere but he can't find it.

And that's because earlier in the day, when no one was looking, Isabel took the toy truck and buried it in the sandbox.

So Joshua looks everywhere and he can't find his toy truck. Mother gets mad at Joshua, because he lost his truck.

**ToMB2_2AFC_37:** Is it fair that Mother is mad at Joshua for losing his truck? Why?/Why not?

**ToMB2_2AFC_40:** Is mother mad at Isabel?

**ToMB2_EXPL_41:** Why/why not?

**ToMB2_2AFC_38:** Is Joshua mad at Isabel?

**ToMB2_EXPL_39:** Why/Why not?

When Isabel sees that Mother is mad at Joshua, she goes to the sandbox and digs up the toy truck, and gives it back to Joshua.

Is Mother mad at Joshua now? Why/why not? (not coded)

Is Mother mad at Isabel now? Why/why not? (not coded)

Is Joshua mad at Isabel now? Why/why not? (not coded)

Isabel tells Joshua that she's very sorry, and she gives him a big hug. Joshua gives her a big hug back, and Mother and Ivan and Sprint join in.

OK, now it's time to go home! That was a good long day at the playground!
